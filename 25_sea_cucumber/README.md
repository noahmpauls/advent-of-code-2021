# Day 25: Sea Cucumber

A pretty simple one-part problem to wrap things up, as usual. Nothing too spectacular about this solution, except that it brings me to the end of Advent of Code!

Rust is a great language. I expected it to be incredibly difficult to work with, and while some aspects were challenging at first, I got enough practice with the fundamentals to start thinking like the compiler. After that, writing Rust felt natural and fun. Iterators are one of the greatest language constructs I've ever used in any language, and their power to handle almost every problem is mind-blowing.

In the future, I hope to be writing a lot more Rust. I want to explore some of its more advanced features, gain a deeper understanding of how it works, and create practical applications with it (especially in WASM!). This language should have a bright future ahead of it.
