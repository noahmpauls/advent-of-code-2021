# Day 12: Passage Pathing

Recursive algorithms in Rust are not my favorite, and overall I feel like there was a better way to do this in Rust. There was a lot of mutation, a lot of copying, a lot of for loops, and not a lot of iterators.

One thing I really miss is duplicate function names with different parameters. Having that makes recursive methods and their callers much easier to name.
